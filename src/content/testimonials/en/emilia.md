Last year's DevFest was an amazing event, and being able to help and be useful made it even better. I had the opportunity to meet people from all over Italy who share my passions and, most importantly, who have managed to turn their passion into a career. Through them, I learned many things, but the most important is that by working hard, you can achieve your dreams.
